# Predictive-Audit-Risk-Modeling

ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project focuses on Audit Risk Prediction in Finance using machine learning techniques. In the financial sector, audit risk assessment is critical for ensuring compliance, detecting fraud, and maintaining the accuracy of financial statements. The workflow begins with data preprocessing steps such as removing duplicates, handling null values, detecting and treating outliers, and checking for multicollinearity. After preparing the dataset, multiple classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are applied to predict audit risks. The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, classification report, and confusion matrix to identify the most reliable approach for financial risk assessment.

ðŸ”‘ Key Highlights

Performed data cleaning & preprocessing (duplicates, nulls, outliers).

Applied feature scaling and encoding for better model performance.

Conducted multicollinearity checks using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).

Implemented machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.

Evaluated results with accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

Visualized findings using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Highlighted the financial importance of audit risk detection for fraud prevention, compliance, and investor confidence.

âœ… Conclusion

The project demonstrates that machine learning can play a crucial role in predicting audit risks in finance by identifying irregularities and risk patterns within business and financial datasets. From a financial perspective, audit risk prediction helps minimize fraud, ensures compliance with regulatory standards, and improves investor trust by strengthening the reliability of financial reporting. Among the tested models, ensemble methods like Random Forest provide more robust and accurate predictions, making them particularly valuable in financial auditing and governance.
