# Predictive-Audit-Risk-Modeling

Project Overview

This project focuses on Audit Risk Prediction using machine learning techniques. The workflow begins with data preprocessing steps such as removing duplicates, handling null values, detecting and treating outliers, and checking for multicollinearity. After preparing the dataset, multiple classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are applied to predict audit risks. The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, classification report, and confusion matrix to identify the most reliable approach for risk assessment.

Key Highlights

1. Performed data cleaning & preprocessing (duplicates, nulls, outliers).

2. Applied feature scaling and encoding for better model performance.

3. Conducted multicollinearity checks using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).

4. Implemented machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.

5. Evaluated results with accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

6. Visualized findings using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
